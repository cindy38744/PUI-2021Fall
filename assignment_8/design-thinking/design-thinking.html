 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p>This work was written during the fall semester in 2020 from August to December. It is an individual project for EGIA (Educational Goal, Instruction, and Assessment). The work includes a complete course plan and the rationales behind, the focus, and the suggestions for each facet of the educational interventions. The course plan is made from scratch and it’s mainly guided by my instructors-Sharon and Lauren. I began by selecting a topic and the targeted leaners and followed the logic of backward design. I hope the work can help people who want to leverage the power of design thinking to implement a course plan make better design decisions </p>
 

        <div class="section-header">Goal</div>
<p><span>“Design thinking provides a way to think about creative work. It starts with empathy, working to really understand the problems people are facing before attempting to come up with ideas and create solutions.” -A.J. Juliani</span>

    <span>Design thinking is widely used to solve complicated real-world challenges that are not only limited to the design industry. It also benefits those in architecture, fashion, technology, and engineering. (Kelly and Cunningham) It is also vital to creativity and innovation and has become increasingly important in the current movement of developing and implementing integrated STEM education.</span>
    
    <span>Based on existing research and theories, I want to promote the benefits of design education to college students outside design departments through instructing the learners how to think like a designer and extend what they have learned from the course to their professional fields.<span></p>

<div class="section-header">Backward Design</div>
<p>In this project, I followed backward design for my course design. Backward design is backward because instructional designers start by defining the learning goals and then decide how can we assess whether learners meet the goals. After goal setting and assessment design, we then design the educational intervention. Lastly, we cover evaluation design to iterating our instruction design. /p>

    </div>
<p>Except for backward design, another key point for my work is the "Big Ideas", which is defined as the primary areas of focus. The course follows the logic of Design Thinking  Process coupled with the educational standards from d.school at Stanford  and “Reflect” stage from Liberatory Design, K12 Lab Network.</p>

<p>For each stage, instructors should be able to answer those questions:</p>

<div class="section-header">01 Learner in Context</div>
<p>My target learners are college students majoring Computer Science at a typical 4-year educational system in the U.S. In broader term, the course can be extended to college students for engineering department. This course plan is intended to be an additional elective workshop for students who seek a way to solve problems through design thinking. Therefore, the learners are different from other students in the department in a way they want to utilize what they have learned from the course to their professional fields.</p>

</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Learning Environment</div>
<p>The learning environment is an open classroom allowing students to exchange ideas easily and present their ideas to the whole class in a quick way.</p>


<div class="section-header">02 Goal Setting</div>
<p>To break down these big goals, the goals are oragnized by conceptual knowledge, that is what students should know, procedural knowledge, what students should do, and dispositional knowledge, what students should be.</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">03 Assessment Design</div>
<p>A successful assessment design comes from thinking like an assessor who focuses on
    the transferability rather than an activity designer.
    In this section, we are heading to the second stage of backward design(goal settingassessment
    design-instruction design), I will talk about types of assessment that would
    be used to get the evidence of learning and how these assessments associate with the
    goals I specify for the previous section.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-header">04 Instructional Design</div>
    <p><span>This course plan is a 3-day workshop from Friday to Sunday. The instruction is innate fast-paced because I condense the regular long-termed product design process into a 10-hour workshop. Therefore, the course might not be exhausted, but it covers key concepts a person without any prior knowledge should learn.</span>

    <span>Also, the course is centered around key performance tasks and driven by design challenges as prompts to guide students’ thinking. Students are taught the definitions and rationales for each design step and immediately asked to demonstrate their understanding given a worksheet about a design challenge. The design challenges coupled with several prompts serve as scaffolding approach to help students master the goals we assign in the previous chapter.</span></p>
    <div class="sub-section-header">Classroom Norm</div>
    <p>I plan to structure the goals of the unit based on the following performance tasks. Through the course plan, students will be able to:</p>

    <div class="section-header">05 Evaluation Research</div>
<div class="sub-section-header">Educational Impact</div>
<p>Impact refers to how implementation affects students' learning. For evaluation research, impact comes first since it's about "effectiveness" of the course.

    When students begin their college, we split the students into two groups. Students are randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group takes the course at the first year of their program. At the last year of their program, we compare the difference between two groups.</p>

    </div>

<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p>This is my first time to work as an instructional design and to walk through a whole course design process. I talked with my instructors many times and have iterated between each phase along the process. As a previous design student, it's an opportunity to promote what I've already learned to more people but with a different role. This work also equips me with more experience with research, paper, and theories, which can help my future work as a researcher in both learning science field and design industry.</p>
