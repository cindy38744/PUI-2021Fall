 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
    <p>CMU Capstone Project is where I work with a team of 4 and help our client Schoolifed to deliver better Social Emotional Learning(SEL) for K-12 online classroom through new interface design that is based on emotional models and teacher interviews. CMU Capstone Project is a seven-month project for an external client that students can apply the techniques, theories, and methodologies that they have mastered in the program to deliver a prototype that meets clients goals and problems. Students gain practical experience while they work with faculty and industry mentors in a team-based research and development project.

        <span>This year we as a team work with Shoolified-an early-stage startup developing an e-learning platform targeting synchronous K-12 education in a remote environment. The planned product offerings are comprised of 4 distinguishing features(Teacher Dashboard, Classroom, Homework Manager, and Lesson Composer) powered by a robust machine-learning core to analyze and deliver optimal content to educators and students. Based on four-month research work, we decided to focus on how to incorporate social emotional learning(SEL) in their platform to deliver better student learning experience.</span>

        <div class="section-header">Problem</div>
    <p>Remote teaching presents novel challenges for educators who do not have the benefit of physical presence to guide their students. Many products already exist to address these challenges, yet none provide comprehensive solutions, and they are frequently cumbersome to operate. The purpose of this project is to identify clear areas where Schoolified’s classroom management suite can be improved to address these challenges further, making it easy and convenient for educators to fulfill their needs and accomplish their goals.

        <span>To identify these opportunities, we conducted interviews with 13 K-7 teachers about their experiences teaching in classrooms before and remotely during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on their experiences with technology during this period and how they created lessons for their classrooms. </span>
        
        <span>Social and emotional status, especially regarding student focus and attention, is a major opportunity area based on teacher interviews and the existing marketplace. 77% of teachers surveyed noted that it was very difficult to track student attention and social/emotional status in the remote setting. 69% expressed that it is important to them to be able to track their students' social and emotional development. Based on these findings, we recommended a system to track student emotional status during live classroom instruction, and subsequently carried out a number of prototyping activities to illustrate its desired functionality. </span></p>

        <div class="section-header">Design Challenges</div>
        <p>Considering that Schoolified is a nascent platform, we identified numerous design challenges for our work and testing. Due to the summer timing of the project, a main challenge was a limited base for user testing, as school was not in session. After identifying the challenges, we decided on the following mitigation strategies.</p>

   <div class="section-header">Research</div>
<div class="sub-section-header">Literature Review</div>
<p>Literature Review
    We started our research work by identifying six research areas that can help our clients’ current work. Then we prioritized the research areas and found relevant research papers.
    Since we decided to focus on “Affect and Motivation”, our research findinds and insights will only focus on socaial emotional learning for the rest of our research section.
    Based on interview data, affect and motivation warranted deeper investigation. There are 6 key learning emotions, and a number of strategies for measuring them with technology.  Adapting to this dimension can lead to improved learning outcomes.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-header">Competitive Analysis</div>
    <p>In this section, we highlight several competitors to Schoolified according to  products, features, and market strategies. In total, we identified 7 different competitive dimensions.</p>
   
    
    
   
    <div class="content-image">

    </div>

<p>We focus on Learning Analytics Dashboard, which helps our future design a lot for Schoolifed’s Teacher’s Dashboard. These tools are meant to provide numerical data to teachers in the form of easy-to use dashboards that give relevant information on student performance. They are all tightly integrated with their respective LMS, as that is the most convenient way to capture data associated with performance.</p>


<div class="sub-section-header">Interview</div>
<p>We decided to conduct interview after prioritizing what kind of research we are required to finish during the spring semester. We made the interview guide first and recruited our target participants(2nd-4th grade teachers are preferred) and worked together to finish 13 interviews.</p>

<div class="section-header">Synthesis</div>
<p>After collecting 13 teachers’ interview data, we synthsized our findings and insights through interpretation session, we pulled up key notes from each participant and categorized releveant notes togther in Miroboard. </p>

<div class="section-header">Insights</div>
<div class="quote">“Teachers use constant passive observation to intuit student’s social/emotional state and attention. Current remote solutions inhibit this observation and intuition.”</div>


<div class="section-header">Ideation</div>
<div class="sub-section-header">Reverb - Student Affective Tracking</div>
<p>Teachers work hard to maintain student attention, and often do not have the ability to monitor all of their students all the time. The feedback of when during their teaching students are losing attention, and exactly which students are having trouble would allow them to capitalize on the desire to customize lessons to their student’s interest and identify students who are having trouble staying on task.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Emotional Models</div>
<p>Before designing interfaces, we worked with teachers to identify a model of student affect that would be useful in a live classroom setting. Based on research done by D’Mello & Graesser (2015), we first decided to target emotion on two different levels - background moods (lasting for several hours or days) and shorter-term affective states (lasting for seconds or minutes). We used the Ekman model for emotion as well as Schoolified’s classroom mood survey as a starting point for background moods, and D’Mello’s list of classroom emotions as a starting point for affective states. Ekman’s model is based on facial expressions of humans that transcend cultural barriers, and while not a perfect model of background moods, we began with it due to its long research history and wide availability of “off-the-shelf” technology products.</p>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/capstone/Models.png" alt="Models">
</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Models Refinement</div>
<p>While interviewing teachers, we focused on which emotional states warranted a response, and how teachers would respond to that particular emotion.  We found that teachers were really focused on those that warranted a response, and revised our model for both background moods and affective states to reflect only those that received a response.</p>

</div>


<div class="section-header">Prototype - Classroom Interface</div>
<p>After identifying emotional models and talking to teachers for feedback, we developed our features to Schoolifed's current platform through classroom interface where teachers can students spend most of their time on their product. We iterated on our classroom prototype several times through continuing talking to teachers and advisors and incorporated feedback in our final prototype.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Interface Structure</div>
<p>We analyzed Schoolifed’s platform and different modes in a classroom, we proposed to incorporate emotion tracking under present mode so that teachers can adapt their contents based on students’ affective states.</p>
   
<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/capstone/InterfaceStructure.png" alt="Interface Structure">
</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">General Tracking</div>
<p><span>General tracking is divided into “Timely Affective States” and “Average Affective States”. Based on our observation with teachers, Timely Affective States is the most useful section to track students’ emotional states to see the trend. As for Average Affective States, they would rather see the report of their teaching after class.</span>

    <span>One big change is that we cover students under a mood to let teachers target students’ issue. Many teachers from our last interviews indicated that it’s a very good features and they would use if frequently.</span></p>

    </div>
    
<div class="sub-section-header">Individual Tracking</div>
<p><span>Another big change is to add “Watch List” that teachers can drag specific students who might be issues in some subjects. In Watch List, teachers can first track their emotional issues. </span>

    <span>After teachers find a student is very confused or very disengaged, they can enter their indivual panel and enter drop in mode with that students. However, many teachers indicated that a better way for them to check in with a student is to see their faces. </span></p>

<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p>Capstone project is valuable experience for me to work with clients and deal with real-world design challenge. Except for that, I learned a lot from my team mates from different profession and my professors and industry mentor about how to incorporate theories and insights to develop better learning experience. At the same time, it's also a great opportunity to apply what I've learned from the program as an instructional designer and research work to design practice as a designer and researcher.</p>
