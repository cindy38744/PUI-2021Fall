 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p><span>‚ÄùSolar and Lunar" is an intern work featuring LED lighting panels I worked on when I was an intern at Xcellent Design in Taiwan. Xcellent Design is a design driven brand manufacturer with the senses of creative, innovative, aesthetics and lifestyle to generate the better products, the proper service and meaningful value about function, material and scenario. The humanistic oriented thinking, style-led aesthetic experience is the core thinking for each design.</span>

    <span>In this intern project, I followed the design philosophy of Xcellent and I was mentored by one of their designers Nicole, who is primary in charge of graphic design and design system at Xcellent Design.</span></p>

<div class="section-header">Lighting Panel Technique</div>
<p>Millions of 3D Microlens are built on the surface of acrylic glass to control the light preciously and minimize the light lost to 3~7%. Tru-Edge illumination with patented light input to generate nearly 360 degree emitting and silk-like visible soft light. To configure various Microlens pattern on each side of light guide, we create a comfortable ambience.</p>

    </div>
    
<div class="sub-section-header">Design Decisions</div>
<p>The features of Microlens leads to an unlimited type of performance. Therefore, it's the designer's work to determine how to showcase the beauty of lightness from Microlens. The design is primarily determined by the form to match up the styles and usage of room. It can be elegant, can inspirational. Also, the interaction between light and accessories produces stacking and silhouette effects, providing more design and customization possibilities. Unlimited possibility to apply on home decoration, gift innovation and culture creativeness.</p>
  
<div class="section-header">Inspiration</div>
<div class="quote">"Infusing eastern culture into lighting design" - a door, a window, a cave, encircling scenery and humanity culture into a frame, namely "view of frame".
</div>
<p>Frames, circles represent eastern architectural style. The reflection of mountains, landscapes and bridges in water expresses the beauty of symmetry.</p>
<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/solar-and-lunar/inspiration.jpeg" alt="inspiration">
</div>

<div class="section-header">Sketch</div>
<p>From the "frame" ideas, I camp up with three concepts to my lighting products, each of them follows the design style and the usage of Microlens technique of Xcellent.</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">Refinement</div>
<div class="sub-section-header">Form and Structure Testing</div>
<p>After choosing the first sketch for the lighting design, I made several designs for the proportion and arrangement based on the concept. I tried different variations and proportion to see what's the better way to present the idea and test the mechanical structure in terms of workability.</p>
<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/solar-and-lunar/refinement.png" alt="Refinement">
</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Lighting Panel Testing</div>
<p>For light panels setting, I made 3D models in Solidworks in order to simulate the effects of brightness.  I compared their lighting effects and the structures. The second one is mechanically unstable because the upper part of the product is too heavy and it lacks the solid foundation to support the lighting panels. The third one is balanced in terms of the brightness, but I choose to be more decorative instead of practical.</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">Testing Model</div>
<p><span>To test the model with real lighting panels, I made many variations in Illustrate for later laser cutting to better understand which one is concrete enough for users to perceive the mountains but abstract enough to be an elegant lighting design. </span>

    <span>Then I output the laser cutting panels and test the lighting effects with real lighting panels, the lighting is limited because the panels are small compared to the whole product and the light is downward instead of upward and forward. There's another issue of "heat" in this design since I used foam board instead of metal, the product turns very hot after a couple of minutes. There will be another issue for using metal in this design, however. There should be enough room to release heat from the panels, so the thickness of the metal should be taken into consideration.</span></p>

<div class="section-header">Final Product Rendering</div>
<p>As final product rendering shows, the product is better used in high-end restaurant or hotels for the elegant and classical atmosphere. The product is not mainly used to be functional. Rather, it is decorative, so other light sources are still required with the product.</p>
