 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p>Digital service is unique in the way that the value is increasing continuously after the digital product is launched. In this case study, I analyzed one of the best music streaming service Spotify through MVP(minimum viable product), value flow model, SET and POG(Product Opportunity Gap) analysis, and PESTLE analysis to see why Spotify can stand out today. </p>
 

        <div class="section-header">Goal</div>
<p>In this case study, I focused on these main topics:
    <br>1. What factors drove the founders of Spotify develop a music streaming service in 2006?
    <br>2. What makes Spotify different from the competitors such as Apple Music and YouTube Premium?
    <br>3. Why customers of Spotify are willing to subscribe and stick to using the service?</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">Spotify at Launch</div>
<p><span>The company mainly provides an audio streaming platform, also called "Spotify", that was launched in October 2008. It offers DRM-restricted recorded music and podcasts, including
    more than 60 million songs, from record labels and media companies. </span>
    
    <span>As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements or automatic music videos, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can browse by parameters such as artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists. </span></p>


<div class="sub-section-header">Minimum Viable Product(MVP) in 2008-2009</div>
<p>When Spotify was launched in 2008, it provided service to mobile and desktop devices and its music resources mainly came from primary record companies. In 2008, Spotify had already a run a community between their users and AD supporters. Unlike MVP in 2008, Spotify today provides their streaming service to more devices such as wearable devices. Spotify also has a more diverse user communities through more subscribe options and social media. In terms of their music resources, Spotify includes more independent music around the world today and they also optimize their streaming service be incorporating machine learning to their playlists and recommendation preference. </p>

    <div class="quote">“What is the difference between MVP in 2008 and the model today?”</div>

<div class="section-header">Value Flow Model</div>
<p>From value flow model, I mainly analyze the relation between service company, user community, and music industry. This chart focuses on how Spotify provides copyrighted music from music industry and their music streaming to their community. Also, this model includes how Spotify expands their users and the relation between advertising and free users.</p>

</div>


<div class="section-header">SET Analysis and Product Opportunity Gap(POG)</div>
<p>The SET analysis reveals that Spotify's success mainly lies in social factor. In 2006, people had multiples ways to listen to music, but it only limited to people have songs and playlists themselves. They don’t really share music to others. Also, the issues of copyright at that time was in absence. In terms of technology, the launch of iPod in 2006 contributed to the increasing sales of songs and albums in Apple’s iTunes(reaching up to 1 billion). This implies that many people bought digital form of music even if many free and illegal songs were accessible. Therefore, in 2006, different way to listen to music started to thrive either in music devices or online platform. Microsoft Zune, Discman, Walkman, Napster, and Winamp are examples in this era. The thrive of so many products implies that the potential of music market.</p>

</div>


<div class="section-header">PESTLE Analysis</div>
<p>I think the focus for PESTLE would centered around **Economic, Social, and Technology.** It’s similar to SET analysis, but more detailed. However, the Political/Legal factor is the most important part to influence the music market after 2006 when people began to concern issues about copyright and piracy.

    <br>Personally, I think the success of Spotify lies in:
    <br>1.The transfer from CDs/MP3 players to digital formats of music (Economic/Social/Technology)
    <br>2.No download, high-quality, legal(Technology/Legal)
    <br>3.Keeping what’s popular in Napster(sharing music) to develop their service (Social)</p>

<div class="section-header">Personas</div>
<p>To identify user needs, I created three personas from different dimensions as a Spotify user. Each of them has different motivations based on the analysis in previous sections.</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p><span>Spotify doesn’t succeed by chance. Spotify’s founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon recognized market gap and spent much time and efforts developing a new music streaming service that both meet music consumers’ needs and copyright issues.</span>

    <span>Although they built Spotify mainly from the ashes of Napster, Spotify introduced a new way to listen to music without the limitations of physical media or ownership and they are still working on improving user experience today.</span></p>
