 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
    <p>In this project, I worked with 3 team members to conduct a variety user-centered research methods to understand young adults’ perception in the home buying process. We worked with our client-Blend in this project in the way that people from their design and research give feedback and ask questions.
        The project ended with a prototype from insights of speed dating and we tested our idea through experience prototyping to make revisions to fit our intended user needs.</p>

        <div class="section-header">Problem</div>
    <p>Based on our research, we’ve identified two pain points for first-time home buyers. One is there’s a financial barrier for young adults and the other one is the needs to organize the research work in the home buying process. Therefore, we are aiming to help first-time home buyers through breaking down the steps and information in a clear and simple way.</p>

        <div class="section-header">Method</div>
        <p>We began our research by recruiting young adults who either had or did not have home buying knowledge to learn more about their needs. In each stage we conducted a variety of research methods that help us generate insight into a young adult’s perception of home-buying, their pain points, and misconceptions.</p>

   <div class="section-header">Think Aloud</div>
<p>To know how people use current digital platform to finish key tasks during the home buying process at quickenloans.com. We conducted Think Aloud on one of the current platforms. We assigned our participants three main tasks and asked them to speak out every thought and action in their minds.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-header">Contextury Inquiry</div>
    <p>Our team began by creating an interview guide, before seeking out interviewees who were in our target demographic. We conducted an artifact analysis followed by a semi-structured interview. We completed interpretation sessions on those interviews and created an affinity diagram from our notes of those sessions.</p>
   
    
    
  <div class="sub-section-header">Process</div>

<p>We recruited four participants and conducted our contextual studies through Zoom meetings. The participants we recruited were young adults in their 20s with limited experience in home-buying and expecting to make a moderate income. Out of the four participants we recruited had homebuying experience.
    Our contextual interview begin with artifact analysis, where participant brainstorm a list of resources they would use in their home-buying process and come ready to show/talk about each of the resources they chose. The second part of our contextual study is a semi-structured interview, where we prepared questions that help us gain a better understanding about how young adults or inexperienced home-buyers start their navigation and preparation for buying a hous</p>

<div class="section-header">Speed Dating</div>
<p>In speed dating session, we come up with some ideas based on insights and user needs from previous work. Before our ideation, we put all our research work together and each of us left sticky notes where they feel it’s insightful or important for our future work. We first condensed insights, needs, questions before ideation.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Identify User Needs</div>
<p>After walking the wall, we spent 8 minutes on idea creation. Each of us went through our ideas while other team members took notes on each one. After coming together to discuss the notes we made and various needs we identified, we then decided to develop our storyboards based on 4 main user needs.</p>

<p>Selected storyboard#2: Interactive mortgage simulator game where user chooses mortgage plan for a few personas. Any mortgage vocabulary will have a definition attached to them. After user make the decision to select a plan, the game shows whether that decision fits the persona and why.</p>



<div class="section-header">Experience Prototyping</div>
<p>We used our prototype to conduct experience prototyping through Zoom meeting. For our experience prototyping, each participant shared their screens on Zoom and went through the clickable prototype we made in Figma. Our prototype is intended to deliver on desktop, so we asked our participants to pull up our prototype on their laptops. When they went through the prototype, the interviewer asked some research questions about their experience and some follow-up questions if necessary. We asked our participants to perform a few tasks in our prototype to get a sense of how they interact with our idea.</p>
