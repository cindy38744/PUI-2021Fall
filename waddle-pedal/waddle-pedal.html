 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p>Waddle Pedal is my thesis project when I was in my last year in Industrial Design Department. It's a required project lasting for two semesters and we need to work like a professional product design team. We as a team walked through double diamond design process from research, insights, ideation, to prototypes. We also worked with advisors in our department and the industry. We have regular presentation every month and a final exhibition at the end of the project.</p>

<div class="section-header">Introduction</div>
<p>Waddle Pedal is a bicycle playground designed for kids. Kids are able to learn how to ride a bike and enjoy bikes more with the help of Waddle Pedal. In this playground, we design the route for better learning and apply arduino sensors to the light on the ground to produce interaction with kids on bikes.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Three Steps Learning</div>
<p>Nowadays, children will first ride on a bicycle without pedals. By sliding, they can train their balance and then they can put on the pedals to slide. Finally, they can practice riding bicycle directly.</p>

<div class="section-header">Competitive Analysis</div>
<p>To explore current kids bicycle market, we compared several different bicycles for kids. We found that they target broader user ages through transformational bike design since it’s common that parents buy a new bike to fit their kids’s age.</p>

<div class="section-header">Interview</div>
<p>During weekend, we as a team like went to the park near the university. There are many families and some kids are riding a bike there. We asked some groups for interview permission and conducted the interview with them. Our primary interviewees are parents with experience about teaching their kids how to ride a bike because our main user group is kids from 3 to 5. Except for parents, we also talked to some older kids with riding bike experience. Our interview topics are:</p>

</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Interview Demographic</div>
<p>We talked to 7 famliies in total and we got interview data from 10 children, 5 boys from 1.5 years old to 7 years old and 5 girls from 3.5 years old to 11 years old about their bike learning experience</p>

<div class="section-header">Insight</div>
<p>After all research work, we synthesized our findings and insights through affinity diagramming. Our insights focus on how kids learn how to ride a bike and some possible ideas to help our users. For someone who is able to ride a bike, it seems to be nothing difficult. But if we break down the whole process, separate every step and move, all of a sudden it appears to be one of the hardest things. Meanwhile, experts have suggested that children of 3 to 7 years old are at an opportune time to try riding bicycles, so they can have balance and physical coordination training. Being totally unfamiliar to the tool, all the timing and action-switching shouldn’t be easy to children.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Restriction of Product Design - A Field for Bicycles</div>
<p>After our first iteration of ideation, we found that bike is limited in spaces. We can design a product for better riding experience, but it’s minimal because of the limitation of space. The high-flexibility of bicycles makes them less limited to environment. Parks, allies can be places to practices riding, but are they the most appropriate options? We hope to build a place that is the best choice for bicycles beginners, enhance riding experience while preserving the original way of riding bicycles.</p>
<div class="quote" style="color: orange;">Pivot: Design for the "space"</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Restriction of Product Design - A Place for More Fun</div>
<p>For children under 7, playing is how they explore the world. At this age, there’s nothing more important than playing. Considering that, shouldn’t riding bicycles also be an act of playing? We hope this field we design can present the difference after children learn how to ride bicycle, and enjoy themselves the most because they’re on bicycles.</p>

</div>

<div class="section-header">Prototype Idea - Playground Map</div>
<p>Our first draft of prototype is to divide the playground into two sections, that is exercising section and playing section. We plan to have a continous route from exercising section to playing section for better experience.</p>

</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Learning Section</div>
<p>The Learning Section is composed of six smaller sections, each is related to different steps of riding bicycles - gliding, braking, straight-line, turning, hill-climbing, and avoiding objects.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Challenging Section</div>
<p>The Challenge Section connects the six stages of the Learning Section into a continuous track. The section plays as a verification of the learning result.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Playing Section</div>
<p>Covered with interacting lights, the Playing Sections comes into four modes. Through color-changing, different glowing modes, this section shows how much fun a bicycle can bring</p>

<div class="section-header">Combination of Product Design</div>
<p>The sensor connects the bike and the playground. It will be attached on the front wheel of the bike at the information counter as a medium for interaction between the bike and the playground. The principle is to use the infrared ray to transmit data and generate feedback.</p>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/waddle-pedal/sensor.png" alt="Sensor">
</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">Construction of the Interacting Lights</div>
<p>There are three parts of the construction of the light — acrylic, diffuser, and the base. The acrylic is for supporting the weight of the kid and the bike, the function of the diffuser is to send the light without reducing the brightness of the light, and can also receive the infrared ray more effective. The base is for fixing the LED and the receiver.</p>
<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/waddle-pedal/sensor-1.png" alt="Sensor">
</div>
<div class="sub-section-header">Infrared Ray and Arduino Sensor</div>
<p>The sensor uses infrared ray as its interaction medium with the lights. Also, how the lights change is programed with Arduino coding. The most challenging part here is how to manage the size of the sensor and the arduino sensor inside the product.</p>

<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p>Learning is short-lived, but fun is long-lasted. The process of learning a bicycle varies from person to person, but in general the "learning" of the bicycle is a brief process. What Waddle Pedal hopes to achieve is to integrate people, objects, time, and place into a space through the design of the field. From 0 to 1, from 1 to N, making  “our first time riding bicycle" more fun.</p>
