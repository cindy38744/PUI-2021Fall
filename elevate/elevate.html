 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p>What makes a good digital service product? In this project, I worked with other 3 team mates from Product Management program from digging into the market to refining our digital service ideas. We conducted interviews and different user research methods to understand the current state of the market and how we can meet the gap between users and markets. We named our team and our service "Elevate" because we hope that our users can hone on their design skills through our service. </p>
 
    <div class="content-image">
        <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/overview.png" alt="Overview">
    </div>

        <div class="section-header">Goal</div>
<p>For this project, we would like to understand designer community and how we can innovate digital service that meets the unmet user needs and have market value. This was an ongoing research process where we tried different ways to analyze market opportunities from different perspectives. In the end of the project, we had a concept video showcasing the problem scoping and how our service can enter the market.</p>
     

<div class="section-header">Current State</div>
<p>Currently there are a large abundance of design tools and options which makes it hard for novice designers to know where to start. The role of the tools are not well defined which makes
    the workspace easily overwhelming. Elevate hopes to solve this problem by providing a platform for novice designers to find tutorials and learn new skills while using unfamiliar design tools. Users also receive emails every month on new or relevant skills that Elevate curates based off their preferences.</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Value Flow Model</div>
<p>To better understand how our primitive idea would work in the designer community with different stakeholders, the value flow model presents how Elevate provides the service to our users and how value streams and data work in the model</p>


<div class="content-image">
            <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/valuemodel.png" alt="Value Model">
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">SET Analysis and Product Oppertunity Gap(POG)</div>
<p>To further see how Elevate can fit into the opportunity gap today, we analyzed the social, economic, and technology factors associated with our idea scope. Coupled with PESTLE analysis in next section, we finalized our idea scoping.</p>


<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/SET:POG.png" alt="SET and POG">
</div>

<div class="sub-section-header">PESTLE Analysis</div>
<p>We extended our analysis to five possible external factors(Political, Economical, Social, Technology, Legal, Environment) and prioritized their significance.</p>


<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/PESTLE.png" alt="PESTLE Model">
</div>


<div class="sub-section-header">Competitive Analysis</div>
<p>Except for the factors in general, we conducted competitive analysis to see how current possible competitors meets the market needs and what they did a good job.</p>

<div class="section-header">Unmet User Needs</div>

<div class="section-header">Insights</div>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/insight.png" alt="Insights">
</div>


<div class="section-header">Risks and Mitigations</div>
<p>In this stage, we validated our user needs and current market state, we listed some potential risks for our idea and mitigation ideas.</p>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/risk.png" alt="Risk and Mitigations">
</div>


<div class="section-header">Revised Value Model</div>
<p>Then we revise our value flow model to better fit our idea and the market. We also included how users work inside the designers community.</p>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/valueinside.png" alt="Value Model">
</div>

<div class="section-header">Pivot</div>
<p>From our initial idea of providing a platform for novice designers to find tutorials and learn new skills through personalized newsletter email tutorials, we pivoted this idea to a new idea of a platform for designers to showcase their projects and process/tutorial for designers seeking inspiration.</p>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/pivot-1.png" alt="Original Idea">
</div>

<div class="content-image">
    <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/pivot-2.png" alt="Current Idea">
</div>


<div class="section-header">Minimum Viable Product(MVP)</div>
<p>Designers don’t know that they need to learn something unless they’ve seen it somewhere.
    If only there was a place where designers can find inspiration and also learn new techniques to act on those newfound inspirations.
    
    <br>That’s where Elevate comes in.</p>

    <div class="content-image">
        <img src="../Assets/images/elevate/mvp-1.png" alt="MVP">

    </div>
    


<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p>To reflect on the innovation process for this project, we think we should focus on some customer segments instead of all designers. In that way, we can focus on the pain points for our targeted customers. Also, finding a pricing model would be difficult because we need to find out what motivates our potential customers to pay for the service. Thus, for our additional interview, we mainly focus on what factors drive our users to pay for tutorials and their experience about
    that. We revised our business model by enhancing the value propositions. 
    
    Lastly, the main goal for our service is to make distinction from current practice such as Youtube and other learning platforms that we found many interviewees talked about from the first interview research. We only partly resolved this issue and another issue regarding the pricing model appears, we should analyze more about how to balance between the market and the feature of our service.</p>
