 <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
<p><span>This is the coursework from Typographic System in Industrial Design Department when I was an undergraduate at National Cheng Kung University. In this project, I worked with four team mates. I was assigned as the Design Editor in charge of the font design, cover design, and layout design. Other team members were Editor-in-Chief, Design Editor, Text Editors, and Photographer. </span>

    <span>We worked as a team for two months. First, we discussed what kinds of topics we would like to dig into and who are our audience. We decided to present valuable old school drink shop in Tainan, Taiwan because Tainan is used to be the capital of Taiwan 50 years ago and some of the stores in Tainan are intentionally showcasing the past memory in old times Taiwan. We followed the old school design styles and interviewed three stores that meet our standard-integrating old school style with new young generation energy.</span></p>


<div class="section-header">Goal</div>
<p><span>As the Design Editor, the goals for me are make the design system and design style coherent to our topic. We split the work based on our roles. Text Editors and Photographer output the context for the magazine and I worked on how to present the information in a visually appealing way. Therefore, the layout design should follow grid system and the decisions of typeface and photos are important to meet the goals.</span>

    <span>Also, I worked on font design and cover design from scratch through continuous discussion with my instructor and my team mates about what's the best way to present the conflict between old and new generation in my design. I tested many different designs and kept revising my work for font and cover design.</span></p>


<div class="section-header">Design Style and System</div>
<p>The style for the project is old school in Tainan. Tainan is a well-known old generation city in Taiwan with many templates and old buildings. Coupled with new young energy these days, I would like to present a hybrid of old and new for my design. Some keywords are elegant, classical, majestic, and balanced</p>

<div class="sub-section-header">Typeface</div>
<p>What do you mean by "elegant" typeface in design. For both English and Chinese font types, serif brings a classical mood to document design, serif font types in Chinese are also highly related to Chinese calligraphy for the strong lines and rhythm. Therefore, the typeface in the magazine is serif with different weights in terms of hierarchy.</p>

</div>


<div class="section-header">Font Design</div>



<p>To begin my work on the font design on the cover, I made a mind map to organize my personal understand to this old city. I tried different ideas on paper and then digitalized these sketches in Illustrator with different colors. Except for the main title of our magazine, another issue to work with the subtitle for font design.

    We voted the one as our title font design because the audience can relate more to Chinese calligraphy and it's strong enough to let people notice the title, another candidate is more modern and elegant, which leads to the less sense of old generation.</p>



<div class="section-header">Cover Design</div>
<p>As for cover, I would like to showcase the depth and the length of the old city. We had a lot of great photos for this beautiful old city. After some conversations about the draft of the design, my instructor advised that I could enhance the "conflict" part in our design instead of showing the photo directly to the audience. Therefore, in my next iteration, I added a tearing effect in Photoshop to present the old and new exchange on the cover. The colors used sends a message that we would dig into the old generation from today in the magazine

<div class="section-header">Layout Design</div>
<p>After setting the font and cover design, I worked on the layout design with Text Editor and Photographer. We discussed about what's our priority to show the information. I primarily used big block layout to present those great images for each store followed by clear grid systems. I intentionally showcase the original great photos in our magazine and balance the role of text with those strong photos.</p>

<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
<p>This is my first time to work as a professional team on Document Design. I definitely got a lot of experience as a designer in a team. Reflecting back to this work in 2018, I think I did a great job keeping the design style in a coherent way. I especially like the continuous iterations for font and cover design because I can integrate the instructor and my team mates' ideas into my design.

    For improvement, I think some of the layouts are not very mature and professional. Based on myself in 2021, I would recommend using just one or two font families and keep the font weight and font size limited so that it's clearer and the design system can be more solid and strong.</p>
